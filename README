= imapget - Get IMAP mails.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to imapget version 0.2.1


== DESCRIPTION

Downloads IMAP mails locally. It deletes local mails that are marked as deleted
on the server, but, while in download mode, never ever modifies anything on the
server! Thus, it's different from your typical *sync* tool.
