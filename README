= imapget - Get IMAP mails.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to imapget version 0.0.6


== DESCRIPTION

Downloads IMAP mails locally. It deletes local mails that have been deleted
on the server, but never ever modifies anything on the server! Thus, it's
different from your typical *sync* tool.
